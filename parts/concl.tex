\section{Conclusion and perspectives}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed an approach to automatically infer timed models of Process Hitting from time series data (expressed as chronograms). To do so, we implemented our algorithm in ASP\footnote{All programs, including this generation algorithm and the methods for refinement described in the following, are implemented in ASP and are available online at: \url{http://git.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/benabdal/generate_revise_d-brn/repository/archive.zip}}. We illustrated the applicability and limits of the method through various benchmarks. This opens the way to promising applications in the connection between biologists and computer scientists. Further works will now consist in discussing the kind of information one can get on timed Process Hitting by analyzing the associated untimed model. We also plan to improve our implementation to make it robust against noisy data.
