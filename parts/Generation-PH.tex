% Completion of PH network (Circadian clock)

\section{Generation of PH models}
\label{sec:ph-generation}

This algorithm takes as input a Process Hitting and observation of gene expression according to time for this model (time series data).
Knowing influences of the genes (or assuming all possible influences),
this algorithm will generate a model or complete the input model by adding the delayed actions that could have realized the state changes observed through the observation data.

\subsection{Algorithm}
In this section we propose an algorithm to construct and/or revise Process Hitting models.
We assume that new time series data observations are provided as a {\it chronogram} of size $T$:
the value of each variable is given for each time step $t$, $0 \leq t \leq T$, through a time interval discretization (see definition below and example \pref{fig:discretization}).   

\begin{definition}[Chronogram]
A chronogram is the discretized time evolution of the time series data of each component of biological regulatory networks. It is presented by the fonction below: $$\mathds{N}^+ \longmapsto \mathds{N}^+$$
$$ [0,T] \subset \mathds{N}^+ \longmapsto \{0,1,..., n\}$$
with $T$ is the maximum time point called the size of the chronogram and $n$ is the maximum level of discretization.
\end{definition}

Algorithm \ref{alg:PHG_ap} shows the pseudo code of our algorithm.
If the observations are perfect, it will generate all possible actions that can realize each change observed.
Because of the delayed semantics, it is not possible to decide whether an action is correct or not.
But we can output the minimal sets of actions necessary to realize the changes observed.
%Like in Algorithm \ref{alg:ASPHC}, it generates all possible actions that can realize each change observed.
%But then, since observation are not perfect, we cannot safely removed non-consistent actions.
Otherwise, if the observation data is not perfect, we refine the output model by filters taking into account almost the different possible perturbations. These filters are more detailes in \pref{sec:refinement-filters}.
%Otherwise, if the observations are not perfect, we can merge actions by replacing the one that only differs by the delay by one action whose delay is the average one. The intuition is that, in practice, if there are enough observations, the delay of those actions should tend to the real value.

%In this section we propose two algorithms to complete Process Hitting networks.
%Both algorithms takes as input a Process Hitting and a chronogram of genes evolutions of this network.
%Knowing the genes influences (or assuming all possible influences),
%these algorithms will complete the input network by adding the delayed actions that could have realized the changes observed in the chronogram.
%The first algorithm we propose is a complete approach:
%assuming that all input observations are perfect it will correctly revise the input Process hitting by adding new actions and removing existing ones.
%Algorithm \ref{alg:ASPHC} show the pseudo code of our completion algorithm.
%It first consider the gene changes, to generates all possible actions that can realize each change.
%At this step, new actions can be added to the input network to perform the changes observed that no current action in the network could perform.
%Then, it consider the time steps where there is no changes to remove the actions that would made one at this moment.
%Here, both the actions generated and existing ones that are not consistent with the observation are removed from the network.

\begin{theorem}[Completeness]% and Correctness]
	\label{th:correct}
	Let $PH$ be a Process Hitting, $C$ be a chronogram of the genes of $PH$ and $A$ be the set of actions of $PH$ that realized the chronogram $C$.
	Let $PH'$ be a Process Hitting and $A'$ be the set of actions of $PH'$ such that $A' \subseteq A$.
	Given $PH'$ and $C$ as input, Algorithm \ref{alg:PHG_ap} is complete:
	it will output a set of process hitting $S$,
	such that $\exists PH'' \in S$ with $A''$ the set of actions of $PH''$ such that $A \subseteq A''$.
	\begin{proof}
	Let us suppose that the algorithm is not complete, then there is an action $a \in A$ that realized $C$ and $a \not \in A''$.
	After step $1$, $PH''$ contains all actions that can realize each gene change.
	Here there is no action $a \in A$ that realizes $C$ which is not generated by the algorithm, so $a \in A''$.
	Then it implies that at step 2, the action $a$ is removed from $A''$.
	But since $a$ realizes one of the change of $C$ and $a$ is generated at step 1, then it will be presented in one of the minimal subset of actions.
	Such that $a$ will be in one of the networks outputted by the algorithm.
	%It means that there is a time step $t$ where $a$ is applicable, but in the chronogram $C$ there is no gene change at $t$.
	%But since $a \in A$, a change should have occurs at $t$, this is a contradiction.
	%So there is no $a \in A$ that could be remove from $A''$ at step 2, the algorithm is complete.
	$\qed$
	%
	%The algorithm is also correct and this conclusion is trivial from the operation of step 2.
	%If it was not correct, then there is an action $a \in A''$ that is not consistent with $C$.
	%But all such action are removed at step 2.
	%So that the algorithm output is correct.
	%
	%All action of the outputted Process Hitting $PH'$ are consistent with the input chronogram $C$.
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}[Complexity]
	\label{th:complexity}
	Let $PH$ be a Process Hitting, $S$ be the number of sorts of $PH$ and $P$ be the maximal number of processes of a sort of $PH$.
	Let $C$ be a chronogram of the genes of $PH$ over $T$ units of time, such that $c$ is the number of gene change of $C$.
	%The complexity of completing $PH$ by generating actions from the observations of $C$ with Algorithm \ref{alg:PHC} belongs to $O(c\times i^S + (T-c) \times  P \times  i^S)$ that is bound by
	%$O(T^2\times P^{S+2})$.
	The memory use of our algorithm belongs to $O(T \times  P \times  i^S \times  2^{T\times  P \times  i^S})$ that is bounded by $O(T \times  P^{S+1} \times  2^{T\times  P^{S+1}})$.
	The complexity of completing $PH$ by generating actions from the observations of $C$ with Algorithm \ref{alg:PHG_ap} belongs to
	$O(c\times i^S + (2^{2\times T\times  P \times  i^S} + $c$ \times  2^{T\times  P \times  i^S})$ that is bounded by $O(2^{3\times T\times P^{S+1}})$.
	\begin{proof}
		% Memory
		Let $i$ be the maximal indegree of an action in $PH$, $0 \leq i \leq P$.
		Let $p$ be a process of $PH$ and $n$ be the number of sorts that can influence $p$.
		There is $i^S$ possible combinations of those processes that can hit $p$, each of those can form an action.
		There is $P$ processes and at most $T$ possible delays, so that there are $T\times  P \times  i^S$ possibles actions,
		thus at step 1, the memory of our algorithm is bounded by $O(T \times  P \times  i^S)$,
		which belongs to $O(T\times P^{S+1})$ since $0 \leq i \leq P$.
		Generating all minimal subsets of actions $A$ of $PH'$ that realize $C$ can require to generate at most $2^{T\times  P \times  i^S}$ set of rules.
		Thus, the memory of our algorithm belongs to $O(T \times  P \times  i^S \times  2^{T\times  P \times  i^S})$ and is bounded by $O(T \times  P^{S+1} \times  2^{T\times  P^{S+1}})$.
		% Run time
		%At each time step, atmost one gene can change its value in the chronogram $C$.
		%Atmost $i^S$ actions can be produced for each gene change, the complexity of step 1 is then $O(c \times  i^S)$.
		%In step 2 of Algorithm \ref{alg:PHC} at each time step where there is no gene change, it checks all actions generated so far.
		%Since there is $T \times  P \times  i^S$ possibles actions, this operation complexity is $O( (T-c) \times  T \times  P \times  i^S)$.
		%Then the complexity of Algorithm \ref{alg:PHC} is $O(c\times i^S + (T-c) \times  T \times  P \times  i^S)$.
		%Since $0 \leq i \leq P$ and $0 \leq c \leq T$ the complexity belongs to $O(T\times P^S + T^2 \times  P^{S+1})$ and is bound by $O(T^2\times P^{S+2})$.
		
		%Sampling the chronogram (step 1) is linear in the number of time step and then bound by $O(T)$.
		%Merging the actions at step 2 is polynomial in the number of actions and the complexity of this operation belongs to $O((T\times P\times i^S)^2)$.
		The complexity of this algorithm belongs to $O(c\times i^S)$.
		Since $0 \leq i \leq P$ and $0 \leq c \leq T$ the complexity of Algorithm \ref{alg:PHG_ap} is bounded by $O(T\times P^S) = (T\times P^S)$.
		
		Generating all minimal subsets of actions $A$ of $PH'$ that realize $C$ can require to generate at most $2^{T\times  P \times  i^S}$ set of rules.
		Each set has to be compared with the others to keep only the minimal ones, which costs $O(2^{2\times T\times  P \times  i^S})$.
		Furthermore, each set of actions has to realize each change of $C$, it requires to check $c$ changes and it costs $O($c$ \times  2^{T\times  P \times  i^S})$.
		Finally, the total complexity of completing $PH$ by generating actions from the observations of $C$ belongs to
		$O(c\times i^S + (2^{2\times T\times  P \times  i^S} + $c$ \times  2^{T\times  P \times  i^S})$ that is bounded by $O(T\times P^S + (T\times P^{S+1})^2 + 2^{2\times T\times P^{S+1}} + $T$ \times  2^{T\times  P^{S+1}})$
		$\qed$
	\end{proof}
